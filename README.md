Welcome to the Pacman game, a classic arcade experience. I had made this game to understand in depth about python OOPS and data structure.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the game relies on two external libraries, Pygame and Numpy. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Dependencies

To run the game, install the required libraries using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install pygame
pip install numpy
```

These commands will install Pygame and Numpy, which are necessary for the game's graphics and array manipulation.

## Running the Game

Once you have Python, Pygame, and Numpy installed, you can run the game using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Enjoy navigating Pacman through mazes, avoiding ghosts, and collecting those delicious pellets!

Note it is converted using pygbag library hence it can be upto 5x slower on web.
